# Software Repository Must Have a ``Code of Conduct`` File

This is one of the tier 2 standards. See full list [on the overview page](README.md).

## Short description

A Code of Conduct is a document that defines the standards of the developer and user community and outlines how someone should behave when they engage with the community. They usually cover how to respectfully contribute to the software, how to address any problems that may arise, and aim to create an inclusive environment for all involved.

## Importance of this standard

Code of Conduct files help to ensure ethical behavior within a software team and create an environment that is safe and respectful. It also serves as a document that can be referred to in case of incidents.

However, a Code of Conduct is only as good as its enforcement. As you are choosing one, make sure you understand its implications and think about how you will execute its terms  if it is violated.

## Options for this standard

Software teams are welcome to simply duplicate an already existing Code of Conduct file from another repository, start with someone else's file and add changes, or make their own from scratch.

These are some Codes of Conduct to look over for ideas:
- The [Space Telescope Open Source Code of Conduct](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/75d52647344f85527d9b60b6bf38bde46d30e2b2/templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- The [Astropy Code of Conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html)
- The [Numfocus Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct)

There is also the [Github Code of Conduct Template](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project) that can be used.

## How to apply this standard

Software teams should thoughtfully consider the contents they want to go in their Code of Conduct file. When they have decided, their final file should be named `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and should live in the top level of the repository.

Moving forward, teams should always have their code of conduct in mind as they continue their work on the repository and be prepared to call out and/or report behavior that violates this code.

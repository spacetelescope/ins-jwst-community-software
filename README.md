# INS JWST Community Software

This repository is a part of an initiative to have all software tools for the JWST user community that are developed/maintained by the Instruments Division (INS) meet accepted software standards. This includes the software being robust, maintainable, documented, and supported. The contents of this repository aims to describe these standards for the INS software tools and encourage a common approach across projects.

This work is managed by the INS Software Development Leads for this project Mees Fix [@mfixstsci](https://github.com/mfixstsci) and Brad Sappington [@BradleySappington](https://github.com/BradleySappington)

# Software Must Be Available with `conda` or `pip`

This is one of the tier 1 standards. See full list [on the overview page](README.md).

## Short description
While users can download the software files and install the package with `python setup.py install` as described [here](package_structure.md), it is also possible to distribute the software by uploading it to package manager. This can allow the package installation process to be simple, single commands like `pip install <package>` and/or `conda install <package>`.

## Importance of this standard
While packaging the software and having it available as an open source repository is a good way to let users access it, it can be made even easier by allowing the package to be installable with either `pip` or `conda`. Users will be able to use a single-line installation without needing prior knowledge of software, or having to download a copy of the software first.

## Options for this standard
- PyPi (the Python Package Index; this must be a Python package)
- Conda via Conda-Forge (not language dependent)

## How to apply this standard
First, the package setup must be complete such that the software:
- Is installable with `python setup.py`. See [here](package_structure.md) for instructions.
- Has a license file. See [here](license_file.md) for instructions.

To add your package to PyPi:
- See these [instructions from Python](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives)
- Note that these tell you how to upload the package to Test PyPi as a check before uploading it to PyPi. We agree and recommend you install your package from Test PyPi and run your tests locally before determining if you're ready to upload to PyPi.

To add your package to Conda-Forge:
- See their [contributing guide](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html#contributing-packages).
